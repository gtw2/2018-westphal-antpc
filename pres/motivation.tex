 \begin{block}{What is the goal?}
 	PyRe will be used to answer the following questions
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item What is the effect of introducing pyroprocessing plants in the fuel cycle?
 		\item How do various facility designs affect throughput and efficiency?
 		\item Where in a pyroprocessing plant will monitoring most 
 		effectively detect material diversion?
 	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
The first two can be directly answered by the archetype. The third requires data analysis via
diversion algorithms.
