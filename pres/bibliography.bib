	abstract = {Many nations are expanding or initiating nuclear energy programs as part of a national energy portfolio. Transitioning to advanced nuclear energy systems improves sustainability and promotes energy independence. These advanced nuclear energy systems also must be shown to enhance safety, safeguards, and security in order to be realistically deployed. This is of particular concern to nonâ€“nuclear weapons states, to assure compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency treaty obligations. Consequently, the relatively new research area of safeguardability addresses how to integrate goals for safety, safeguards, and security as part of a design strategy for an advanced fuel cycle. This paper presents an overall set of principles that form the foundation of a comprehensive safeguardability methodology, including the quantitative modeling studies derived therein. Results show an approach for characterizing used fuel, functional components to engineering design for nuclear materials handling facilities, and repository analysis. We conclude with an argument for the necessity of an integrative, systems assessment approach to the safeguardability of an advanced fuel cycle.},

	abstract = {In order to enhance the throughput of a pyroprocessing in which electrochemical processes are
mostly engaged, the design of a continuous concept is required. The graphite cathode in the electrorefiner
enables the uranium deposit on the cathodes to be stripped off spontaneously, resulting in a continuous
reaction. The collected uranium deposits at the bottom of the inner cone of the reactor are transferred by a
conveyer. The residuals in the anode basket after the uranium is depleted are noble metals. These are also
collected at the bottom of the outer shell of the reactor, and conveyed from the reactor for a further
treatment. This work addresses the design of the electrorefiner for a continuous operation. The behavior
of particles such as uranium dendrites or noble metals was analyzed to achieve the proper operating
conditions. The operating conditions for the cathode processor in which molten salt is distilled were also
investigated.},

	abstract = {Actinide recycle into a fast-spectrum reactor has been found to be an effective way
to manage the disposition of transuranic isotopes, such as Americium and
Neptunium, which have long half-lives and dominate the calculated long-term dose
associated with releases from repositories. In this presentation, the code
development and irradiation tests regarding the metallic actinide fuels were
reviewed and compared. The models for metallic actinide fuels were analyzed and
the metallic actinide fuels properties were summarized. Based on the above review,
the project research plans were given. We need to develop BISON-OXIDE and
BISON-METAL fuel performance codes, develop constitutive models and simulation
codes to predict actinide fuels materials' properties, and verify the fuel properties
and performance with the existing data and test results. Successful completion of
this project will facilitate an improved understanding of fuel behavior within a
closed fuel cycle.
This presentation is intended for a research team meeting and discussion at INL.},
