CRIEPI have been studying pyro-processing and metal fuel technology since 1986 for obtaining basic properties, process chemistry and engineering technologies. In this century, CRIEPI and JRC-ITU have jointly demonstrated the recovery of MAs from both irradiated metal fuels and spent MOX fuels. Since 2009, accumulation of the design basics through tests with engineering-scale pyroprocessing equipment is carried out by CRIEPI. According to the results obtained in these studies, feasibility of pyroprocessing fuel cycle technology was evaluated through estimation of Technology Readiness Level and cycle cost based on the design study of fuel cycle facility of 40 tonHM/y throughput.},

To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {In order to enhance the throughput of a pyroprocessing in which electrochemical processes are
mostly engaged, the design of a continuous concept is required. The graphite cathode in the electrorefiner
enables the uranium deposit on the cathodes to be stripped off spontaneously, resulting in a continuous
reaction. The collected uranium deposits at the bottom of the inner cone of the reactor are transferred by a
conveyer. The residuals in the anode basket after the uranium is depleted are noble metals. These are also
collected at the bottom of the outer shell of the reactor, and conveyed from the reactor for a further
treatment. This work addresses the design of the electrorefiner for a continuous operation. The behavior
of particles such as uranium dendrites or noble metals was analyzed to achieve the proper operating
conditions. The operating conditions for the cathode processor in which molten salt is distilled were also
investigated.},

In the electrochemical reduction process, oxides fuels are loaded at the cathode basket in molten Li2O–LiCl salt and electrochemically reduced to the metal form. Various approaches based on thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies have been used to understand the electrode reaction and efﬁciently treat spent fuels. The factors that affect the speed of the electrochemical reduction have been determined to optimize the process and scale-up the electrolysis cell. In addition, demonstrations of the integrated series of processes (electroreﬁning and salt distillation) with the electrochemical reduction have been conducted to realize the oxide fuel cycle. This overview provides insight into the current status of and issues related to the electrochemical processing of spent nuclear fuels.},

Discrete event system modeling was used to create an integrated operation model for which simulation showed that dynamic material ﬂow could be accomplished to provide considerable insight into the process operation. In the model simulation, the amount of material transported upstream and downstream in the process satisﬁes a mass balance equation while considering the hold-up incurred by every batch operation. This study also simulated, in detail, an oxide reduction group process embracing electrolytic reduction, cathode processing, and salt puriﬁcation. Based on the default operation scenario, it showed that complex material ﬂows could be precisely simulated in terms of the mass balance. Speciﬁcally, the amount of high-heat elements remaining in the molten salt bath is analyzed to evaluate the operation scenario.},

Here, we demonstrate an anode structure consisting of graphite tubes and a SiC shroud to be applied to the electrowinning process. A large surface area as well as high corrosion resistivity was achieved through the use of inert graphite tubes. The Cl2 (g) capture was enhanced by the employment of a porous SiC shroud. It also allows an efﬁcient contact of the electrode surface to the LiCl–KCl eutectic melt for an anodic evolution. No signiﬁcant effects of the use of a SiC shroud on the anode overpotential and cell potential were found during the U deposition test.},
